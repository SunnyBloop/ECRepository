				    <p><b>Feathered Dinosaurs:</b> Many dinosaurs, particularly theropods, were likely covered in feathers rather than scales. Fossil evidence, especially from China, has revealed the presence of filamentous structures similar to feathers in various dinosaur species.</p>

					<p><b>Not All Dinosaurs Were Giants:</b> While dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachiosaurus are famous for their massive sizes, not all dinosaurs were gigantic. Some were small, comparable to the size of a chicken. For example, the Microraptor, a small theropod dinosaur, had feathers and lived during the Early Cretaceous period.</p>

					<p><b>Dinosaurs Were Not the First Reptiles:</b> Dinosaurs evolved from a group of reptiles known as archosaurs, but they were not the first reptiles to inhabit the Earth. Early reptiles, such as the sail-backed Dimetrodon and the turtle-like Proganochelys, predated the appearance of dinosaurs by millions of years.</p>

					<p><b>Dinosaurs Roamed for a Long Time:</b> Dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic Period, around 230 million years ago, and they dominated the Earth for an impressive 165 million years. They went extinct about 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period.</p>

					<p><b>Dinosaurs Were Warm-Blooded:</b> While it was once believed that dinosaurs were cold-blooded like modern reptiles, recent research suggests that many dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded, exhibiting an intermediate metabolic strategy known as mesothermy. This adaptation could have given them a physiological advantage in regulating body temperature and being more active than cold-blooded reptiles.</p>
